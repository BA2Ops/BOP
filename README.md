* Programming != Coding
* Documentation first, not code
* Documentation is for human reading
* Code is not for human reading
* We do not believe that the mainstream programmer's work status will be the same as it is now in 20 years

## Introduction

There are some long-standing issues in the software coding industry that no one is willing to think about. However, the development of the industry has exhausted the dividends of coding languages, coding tools, CI\CD, etc. The further development of the software industry requires a new paradigm rather than just a technology. Here we share our thoughts and progress on BOP. We hope to demonstrate usable cases of the next generation of coding/programming paradigms within 5 years.
